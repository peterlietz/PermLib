ChangeLog of PermLib
-----------------------

v0.2.8:
fix compiler error (thanks to Jerry James for the report and patch)

v0.2.7:
Add Abstract* classes that 
  - wrap the old API
	- provide a fast implementation especially for direct products of symmetric groups
Add function 'largeDiagonalSubgroup'
Fix a bug in group_refinement (thanks to Ewgenij Gawrilow for reporting this)
Remove code fragments for computing invariants

v0.2.6:
Improve group file format that is used for unit tests
Add -Wshadow, fix shadow warnings
Make PermLib compile with clang (i.e. fix some compliance issues in PermLib)
Improve type recognition
Minor API change in MatrixAutomorphismSearch constructor for initial partition
Fix a bug in Permutation class *= operator (thanks to Peter Lietz for reporting this)

v0.2.5:
Fix bug in BSGS construction algorithm
Add example for finding a small generating set with few generators
Add very basic permutation group type recognition feature
Performance improvements for backtrack search
Add API for vector stabilization
Add experimental backtrack search to determine if a set is not lexicographically
    minimal in its orbit
Convenience constructor for cyclic groups
Methods for computation of the order of a permutation and for group conjugation
Functionality to export a BSGS in elementary data types (C-arrays)

v0.2.4:
Correct handling of trivial group
More unit tests
Fix group copying bug

v0.2.3:
typename clean-up
compute orbits for arbitrary domains

v0.2.2:

v0.2:
Major refactoring of directory structure
BSGS-like structure for the symmetric group
Major changes to API of classic and partition backtracking to support search in symmetric groups
Implemented automorphism search for symmetric matrices


v0.1.1:
Fix Doxygen-CMake dependency
